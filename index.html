								<p>If you would like to read some of my opinions about technology, economics and life check out my <a href="#work">blog</a>. I built the blog from the ground up using Django with a bunch of help from <a href="https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com">Coding for Entrepreneurs</a>. I try and update it regularly, school and work permitting. The views and opinions expressed on the blog do not reflect the views and opinions of my employers or peers.</p>

								<p>I have been doing various bits of programming since I was in High School and have always loved the mystic and challenge it brought. I was brought up doing basic web development using Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 and learning HTML/CSS/JS. I mainly use Python and Javascript nowadays for most of my projects.</p>
								<p>Some of my projects are on <a href="https://github.com/marcus-yeagle">Github</a> if you would like to check out some of my recent stuff. This past school year I have been working with a dietitian to create a photo log application that uses Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to recognize phone pictures automatically to organize and track meals.</p>

								<p>In my spare time I enjoy playing Euchre with my friends, usually while also enjoying a <a href="http://jackieos.com">JackieO's</a> brew. I live in Athens Ohio currently, buy I am originally from Dover Ohio. I enjoy working on side projects like making little games in Python or messing around with Raspberry Pis. I also enjoy playing golf and being outdoors in general. I am a staunch follower of the stock market and love to learn and write about finance and economics. Recently, I have been obsessing over Bitcoin and learning as much as I can about the underlying blockchain technology.</p>
